## Rust first project: wraper of HN
### My approach
- Try to build a simple service with Rust
- If do not understand anything try to practice it
- Save all refrence in ref folder

### What is my goal
- For fun that all :)
- Feel the Rust's way (basic)
- Understand how to manage via cargo
- What is the difference with another (golang or python or C)
